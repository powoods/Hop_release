Code used to analyze powdery mildew data and plot the results for the hop release project.

This repo contains two scripts: 1) Reaction_norm_plotting_script.R and 2) python_script_for_calculation_mean_colony_counts.py

The first script is used to plot the reaction norm style figure used in the publication.

The second script is used to obtain both the summary mean colony counts for each hop line included in the study as well as prepare the data for plotting the reaction norm.
